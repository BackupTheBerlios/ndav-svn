Known bugs
----------

  ndav-0.2.0: Due to properties inherent in libxml2, ndav cannot always
              descend into a directory protected by a digest password.
              For example, 

                ndav -v http://repos.net/dig

              can end with "Bad request" due to a failed PROPFIND when
              Apache2 is used as WebDAV server, whereas the related call

                ndav -v http://repos.net/dig/

              will correctly sense the complete directory.
